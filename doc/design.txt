Linear algebra

- looking at Kmett's "Linear" library
 - four-vectors with positional args (Vec4 a b c d vs Vec4 [a,b,c,d]) seems
  like a good idea
 - Kmett stores matrices as Vecs of Vecs, which I think is a bit much for me
  at this point. maybe later
 - Kmett also has an "epsilon" typeclass which I think I'm gonna steal, for
  determining whether something's close enough to zero to be treated as such
- might just keep everything as 4-vecs to begin with, one day I might need
 (u, v) samples on a surface but that can wait
